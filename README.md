# Kafka Project 
## 1.Add Spring Kafka

I added the Spring for Apache Kafka dependency to my Spring Boot application.

Why?
It provides Spring integration with Kafka, including KafkaTemplate for producing messages and @KafkaListener for consuming messages.

## 2.Run Kafka using Docker

I used Docker to run Kafka locally instead of installing Kafka directly on my machine.

Why?
Docker makes it easier to start, stop and manage Kafka.

Kafka is running on:

localhost:9092


## 3.Create Kafka Topic

I created a topic called:

employee-events

with 2 partitions.

Topic: A topic is a logical category where Kafka stores messages.

Partition: A topic can be divided into multiple partitions for scalability and parallel processing.

## 4.Configure Kafka Producer

I configured Spring Boot with the Kafka broker address:

localhost:9092

Then I used KafkaTemplate to send messages to Kafka.

Producer: A producer is responsible for publishing messages/events to a Kafka topic.

## 5.Integrate REST API with Kafka

I created a REST API through which the client sends employee information.

The flow is:

REST API
   ↓
Spring Boot
   ↓
Kafka Producer
   ↓
Kafka Topic


## 6.Create Employee Event

Instead of sending simple strings, I created an EmployeeEvent Java object containing:

employeeId
name
department

For example:

{
  "employeeId": 101,
  "name": "Rahul",
  "department": "IT"
}

This represents the event that needs to be published to Kafka.


## 7.JSON Serialization

I configured JacksonJsonSerializer.

Serialization means converting a Java object into a format that can be sent through Kafka.

EmployeeEvent
      ↓
JSON Serialization
      ↓
Kafka

So the overall producer-side flow is:

Client
  ↓
REST API
  ↓
EmployeeEvent
  ↓
KafkaTemplate
  ↓
JSON Serialization
  ↓
Kafka Topic



## 8.Implement Kafka Consumer

After producing the event to Kafka, I implemented a Kafka Consumer using Spring Kafka's @KafkaListener.

Why?
The producer sends messages to Kafka, while the consumer reads and processes those messages from the Kafka topic.

The flow is:

Kafka Topic
     ↓
Kafka Consumer
     ↓
Process EmployeeEvent

I configured the consumer with a consumer group called employee-group.

Consumer Group: A group of consumers that work together to consume messages from Kafka.

## 9.JSON Deserialization

Since the producer sends the EmployeeEvent as JSON, the consumer needs to convert that JSON back into a Java object.

I configured JacksonJsonDeserializer.

Deserialization means converting the received JSON data back into a Java object.

Kafka
   ↓
JSON
   ↓
JacksonJsonDeserializer
   ↓
EmployeeEvent

So the consumer-side flow is:

Kafka Topic
     ↓
JSON Message
     ↓
JSON Deserialization
     ↓
EmployeeEvent
     ↓
Kafka Consumer


## 10.Kafka Partitions

I created the employee-events topic with 2 partitions.

A partition is an ordered sequence of messages inside a Kafka topic.

employee-events

Partition 0
-----------
Message 1
Message 3
Message 5

Partition 1
-----------
Message 2
Message 4
Message 6

Why?
Partitions allow Kafka to distribute messages and provide parallelism and scalability.

## 11.Consumer Group

I configured my consumer with:

employee-group

Consumers belonging to the same consumer group can share the partitions of a topic.

For example:

2 Partitions
      ↓
Consumer 1 → Partition 0
Consumer 2 → Partition 1

Important: Within the same consumer group, one partition is assigned to only one consumer at a time.

## 12.Kafka Offset

Kafka maintains an offset for each message within a partition.

For example:

Partition 0

Offset 0 → Message 1
Offset 1 → Message 2
Offset 2 → Message 3

Why?
The offset allows Kafka to keep track of the consumer's progress.

In simple terms:

Offset tells Kafka where the consumer is in the partition.

## 13.Acknowledgement and Offset Management

After a consumer receives a message, we need to consider whether the message was actually processed successfully.

The basic flow is:

Kafka Message
     ↓
Consumer
     ↓
Process Message
     ↓
Successful Processing
     ↓
Acknowledgement
     ↓
Offset Commit

Why is this important?

If the application fails before processing is completed, we don't want Kafka to incorrectly consider the message successfully processed.
